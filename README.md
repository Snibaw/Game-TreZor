# Game-TreZor
An mmorpg that I started to create.

I realized that the project was too ambitious for a single creator who knows little about design. I would have to spend more time on the design than on the code (my favourite part).

So I put this project on hold.
Thanks to Anxox Unity3D for his great tutorial on how to create an RPG. https://www.youtube.com/@anxoxunity3d
